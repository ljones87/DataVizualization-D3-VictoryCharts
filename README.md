Hello!
 This is an example of using react-redux,Victory charting, and api calls to a data.gov site to visualize big data. Thanks to the U.S Energy Information Administration for supplying such thorough, accessible, and well organized information!

To start using me, here's what you'll have to do:


* `npm install`
* `npm start`

Feel free to fork, clone, npm install & start to see current progress

The start script runs webpack in watch mode, and nodemon, so any changes you make to the client or server directories should cause webpack to rebuild and the server to restart, respectively.
